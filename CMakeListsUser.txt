    # Adding the below line for LCDKeypad was UNSUCCESSFUL at stopping usage of the incorrect ~/.platformio/lib/etc.etc.
    # to use the lib we have in our project's lib/.
    # Now we are getting good builds by uninstalling an incorrect lib from ~/.platformio/lib/etc.etc. .. so we
    # don't know that we actually need the below. Disabling to test if we need it.
    # CONCLUSION: We need the below line. It is needed for the IDE live inspection, not the PlatformIO-driven build.
