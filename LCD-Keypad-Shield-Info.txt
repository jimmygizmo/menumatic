This information covers the history and the current state of a useful library for LCDKeypad shields, which can
date back to around 2010. This info was collected in May of 2021.

The README in the original set of files of the LCDKeypad library points to this link:
https://forum.arduino.cc/t/new-library-for-lcd-keypad-shield/38157

This posting is by the author of the library 'fj604' and he also points to places to get the library:
https://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&keyword=lcd&category_id=0&product_id=51

The following note from fj684's posting is taking out of context but seems to note different arduino-to-shield pin
mappings based on using a different dependency lib for just the LCD:
----
fj684: "
The one recommended to use with these is LCD4Bit_mod, but the standard LiquidCrystal library works just as well
with modified pin numbers - use this:
LiquidCrystal(8, 9, 4, 5, 6, 7)
This library (LCDKeypad) inherits LiquidCrystal and adds another method: button - to read button pushed on a keypad.
"  (Exactly what he means and when/if I need this info remains TBD.)

The following detail page on DFRobot's version of the LCD Keypad shield has a lot of detailed info; enough pretty
much re-create what fj604's lib does. Maybe that is why it can no longer be found, because really you just need
to use the LiquidCrystal library and then have just a little bit of code to translate the Analog 0 pin (A0) 5 level
voltage divider signal into calls for presses of the 5 buttons. Something to handle the switch bounce/release also
seems necessary. Anyhow, lots of infor here and this also looks like a very good shield, even nicer than my shield.

The shield I am actually using is a Vellman VM203:

Just for reference, here is the OSEPP version, which I also own, but not currently using on this specific project.
Library/code usage between the different manufacturers is not likely to differ much or at all.

Now I am starting to think that this library by fj604 called "LCFKeypad", now about 10 years old and of minimal added
value, was perhaps NEVER available through Platform IO and now also appears to no longer be available for download
anywhere as the old forum posting above also had a download link which is dead, like many others in the posting.
No problem. I see now that the functionality is easily re-created and I also have a few copies of the original library,
one data from 2012.

Found some additional info in the library.json file of my saved copies of the LCDKeypad lib:
https://github.com/dzindra/LCDKeypad.git
This repo is still here and updated as recently as 3 years ago:
https://github.com/dzindra/LCDKeypad

NOTE: The version stamped in the repo is the same as I have at v1.1.0, so no action necessary.
The Arduino IDE might actually be able to install this lib as his commit messages refer to a restructure specifically
for the Arduino IDE and that might be how I originally got it. Really not sure.

My conclusions have evolved to this: The above repo is the source of truth. I would say it is not necessary to install
the examples or the extra image etc into your projects. My choice might be to simply use the LCDKeypad.cpp and
LCDKeypad.h files and install those into the CLion/CMake project lib/ dir, rather than inside pio libdeps which
am not yet sure you should even mess with manually.
